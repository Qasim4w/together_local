  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: August 18, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Together Local</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices when you use our mobile application (the “App”).</p>

  <h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information</strong>: your <em>email</em>, <em>display name</em>, and <em>profile image</em> for authentication and to show your profile in the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage &amp; Device Data</strong>: basic technical data (e.g., app version, device type, performance/diagnostic events) used to maintain and improve the App.</li>
    <li><strong>User Content</strong>: anything you upload or submit (e.g., profile photo).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Permissions We Request</h2>
  <p>We ask for only what we need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internet</strong> — <code>android.permission.INTERNET</code>: required for the App to communicate with our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Images (Android 13+)</strong> — <code>android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES</code>: used only when you choose a profile image.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage (Android 12 and below)</strong> — <code>android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>: used only to select and upload a profile image from your gallery.</li>
    <li class="muted"><em>Advertising ID is not used:</em> <code>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID</code> is explicitly removed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Permissions are invoked only when you initiate the related action (e.g., selecting an image). You may revoke permissions at any time in your device settings; some features may not work without them.</p>

  <h2>3) How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticate you and operate core features of the App.</li>
    <li>Display your profile (name and image) to you and, where applicable, to other users.</li>
    <li>Maintain, protect, and improve the App, including debugging and security.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about updates, support, and important notices.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We <strong>do not sell</strong> your personal data.</li>
    <li>We may share data with trusted service providers who help us operate the App (e.g., hosting/storage); they may process it only on our instructions and must protect it.</li>
    <li>We may disclose information if required by law, to protect rights/safety, or to enforce our Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We keep personal data only as long as needed to provide the App and as required by law.</li>
    <li>When you request account deletion, we permanently delete your personal data (email, display name, profile image and associated stored assets) from our systems, subject to legal retention requirements.</li>
    <li>Backups may persist briefly and are removed on a rolling basis.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>7) Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access/Update</strong>: You can view and update your profile information in the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions</strong>: You can grant/revoke permissions in your device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion</strong>: You can request account deletion in the App or by contacting us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for children under the age required by local law without parental consent. If you believe we have collected personal data from a minor without proper consent, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.</p>

  <h2>9) International Users</h2>
  <p>Your information may be processed in locations where our or our providers’ servers are located. Data protection laws may differ from your jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>10) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be notified in-app or by other reasonable means. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect means you accept the updated Policy.</p>
